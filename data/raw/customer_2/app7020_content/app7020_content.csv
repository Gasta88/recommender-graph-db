A large segment of that land is dedicated to the Marra Farm Giving Garden, where organic produce is grown and youth educational opportunities are created for the community. The Giving Garden is one of many projects run by Solid Ground, a nonprofit organization focused on ending poverty and undoing racism and other oppressions that are the root causes of poverty.</p><p>The Marra Farm Giving Garden was first introduced to Lighthouse by Chrissy Bauer, Senior Administrative Assistant at Lighthouse. This past spring, Chrissy took some of her volunteer time off (VTO) to work at Marra Farm with her sister. The two worked with other volunteers to harvest beans, dig garden beds, and plant spinach for the fall harvest. Chrissy enjoyed her experience so much that she organized an Urban Farm Work Party for others in the Seattle office this fall.</p>","",https://www.lighthouseglobal.com/news-events/lighthouse-volunteers-at-the-marra-farm-giving-garden,"",15,1,20,13689,"",0,1653001568000,false,"",0,0,4890,4891,"","",false,"","",lighthouseglobal.docebosaas.com,""

355,Company Unification and Optimization Flash Session,"<p>The Company Unification and Optimization (CUO) flash session, led by Dara Thompson, provided a great summary of CUO program and progress to date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the interactive presentation, employees learned that the program is more than getting everyone in InSite, it also is about empowering us to work together to provide exceptional experiences holistically, both to our team members and our clients. By getting us on a single workflow and set of tools, Lighthouse will accelerate innovation, automation, and the adoption of best practices. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The initial release is complete, with approximately 30 percent of the San Francisco staff trained and the first two clients on boarded: Dr First and Celink. We are now gathering feedback from the pilot team and prioritizing the next round of optimizations while we ramp our teams and clients. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The session also featured a rousing game of CUO Jeopardy, led by emcee Talia Karaberis, where participants shared knowledge about the CUO features and optimizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Feedback from the pilot team included the following:</p>
<p>• Finally being able to offer the teams 24/7 coverage which will help the teams with work life balance -Jean Domalis</p>
<p>• Giving us the ability to automate and make quick, small improvements as we need them -Mike Haw</p>
<p>• Combining the best of both worlds across SEA/NY and SF workflows and tools -Matt Korst</p>
<p>• Using the same set of resources to tackle the same problem will allow us to scale faster in the future -Jorge Santisteban</p>
<p>• Solving problems once (vs. currently where we have to solve the problem 3 or 4 times...) which will increase Lighthouse’s pace of innovation -Patrick Par </p>",o_1eds07oai2fl1j651mpo1ncbh7a.mp4,Flash Session Company Unification and Optimization-20200722 1559-1.mp4,8204,1,1,20,14276,3658,20,1595446387000,false,"",0,0,2293,2292,"","",false,o_1eds07oai2fl1j651mpo1ncbh7a.mp4,"","",""

Stacey explains some of the most common forms that a bias takes: affinity bias, halo bias, perception bias, and confirmation bias. She helps you recognize the negative effects of bias within your organization, as well as the benefits to be realized by uncovering bias in decision-making processes.

The murder of her uncle was a family tragedy, was \"immediately resolved\" but no one discussed it. At 18, Eula's father passed from cancer. He was the family's pillar, but again no one talked about it. Despite an aunt telling her at his memorial that she should \"talk about him as much as you can,” Eula pretended like it was no big deal and rarely spoke of her enormous loss. This ended up creating distance from her memories of her father and his spirit. Then in 2020, in the thick of postpartum depression and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eula's husband passed and later her mother. At this point, she was forced to face all the ways navigating grief was necessary for her mental health and that of her then 2-year-old son’s.</p><p><br /></p><p>Eula discusses good grief, how loss makes space for blessings, and how each of our timelines involves constant metamorphosis.
